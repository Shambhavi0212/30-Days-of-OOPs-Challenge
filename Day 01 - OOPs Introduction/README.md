ðŸš€ Day 1/30: What I learned about OOP
Today I started my 30-day journey to understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.

âœ¨ Key takeaways:

1.OOP is all about creating objects that hold both data and the functions (methods) that work on that data.
2.This is different from procedural programming, where we mostly write functions that work separately on data.
3.OOP makes code more organized, easier to maintain, and helps avoid repeating code (thanks to the DRY â€” Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself principle).
4.It also makes it quicker to build reusable applications.
5.I found it interesting how OOP helps in writing cleaner and smarter code!
