# 📌 Day 10 : What I Learned Today — Java Inheritance (IS-A Relationship)

### 👩‍🏫 What I Learned:

1. **Inheritance** allows one class (child/subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent/superclass).
2. The **`extends`** keyword is used to inherit from a class.
3. This helps achieve **code reusability** — we don't need to write the same methods again in the subclass.
4. A **subclass** can use all **non-private** methods and variables of its superclass.
5. I learned how to create a subclass using:
   ```java
   class Subclass extends Superclass
