# ðŸ§  Polymorphism in Java

## ðŸ“˜ Definition
**Polymorphism** is the ability of an object to take on **different forms**.  
In Java, it means you can use the **same method name in different ways** depending on the situation of the object.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example
- Imagine a method called `draw()`:  
  - If called on a **Circle** object â†’ draws a circle.  
  - If called on a **Rectangle** object â†’ draws a rectangle.  
Even though you use the **same method name**, it behaves differently based on the object.

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Polymorphism
1. **Compile-time Polymorphism** (Static Polymorphism)  
2. **Runtime Polymorphism** (Dynamic Polymorphism)
