# ðŸ§© Java Anonymous Class

## ðŸ“˜ What is an Anonymous Class?
An **anonymous class** is a **class without a name**.  
It is **created and used at the same time**.

You often use anonymous classes to **override methods** of an existing class or interface, **without writing a separate class file**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Points
- Created and used **instantly** (no separate class file needed).  
- Can **extend a class** or **implement an interface**.  
- Commonly used for **method overriding** or **quick implementations**.  
- Ends with a **semicolon (;)** because itâ€™s part of an object creation statement.

## ðŸ’¡ When to Use Anonymous Classes?
Use anonymous classes when you need a **short class for one-time use**, such as:
- Overriding a method without creating a new subclass  
- Implementing an interface quickly  
- Passing small pieces of behavior as objects  

---

## ðŸ§  Summary
Anonymous classes make code **shorter, cleaner, and more flexible**, especially when a class is needed **only once**.
