## Types of Errors in Java

| **Error Type** | **Description** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Compile-Time Error** | Detected by the compiler. Prevents code from running. |
| **Runtime Error** | Occurs while the program is running. Often causes crashes. |
| **Logical Error** | Code runs but gives incorrect results. Hardest to find. |

## Common Compile-Time Errors

Compile-time errors occur when the program cannot compile due to syntax or type issues.

### 1) Missing Semicolon
Happens when a semicolon is not added at the end of a statement.  
**Tip:** Java requires a semicolon at the end of every statement.

### 2) Undeclared Variables
Occurs when you try to use a variable that has not been declared.  
**Tip:** You must declare a variable before using it.

### 3) Mismatched Types
Occurs when the variable type does not match the value assigned.  
**Tip:** Make sure the value matches the variable type.

## Common Runtime Errors

Runtime errors occur when the program compiles but crashes or behaves unexpectedly.

### 1) Division by Zero
Happens when a number is divided by zero.  
**Tip:** Always check the denominator before dividing.

### 2) Array Index Out of Bounds
Occurs when you try to access an invalid index in an array.  
**Tip:** Ensure the index value is within the valid range of the array.

## Logical Errors

Logical errors happen when the code runs, but the result is not what you expected.  
For example, performing subtraction instead of addition.

**Tip:** Test your program with different inputs to catch logic flaws.  
This is part of debugging, which you will learn more about in the next chapter.

## Good Habits to Avoid Errors

- Use meaningful variable names  
- Read the error message carefully and check the line number mentioned  
- Check for missing semicolons or braces  
- Look for typos in variable or method names
