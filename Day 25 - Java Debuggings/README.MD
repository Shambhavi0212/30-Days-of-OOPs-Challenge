# Java Debugging

After learning about common errors, the next step is understanding how to **debug** your Java code — that is, how to find and fix those errors effectively.

This page introduces simple debugging techniques that are useful for beginners and helpful even for experienced developers.

## What is Debugging?

**Debugging** is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in your code.

It often involves:
- Reading error messages  
- Tracing variable values step by step  
- Testing small pieces of code independently  

**Tip:** Debugging is a skill that improves with practice. The more you debug, the better you get at spotting problems quickly.

## Print Statements for Debugging

The most basic (and often most effective) way to debug Java code is to use print statements to display values and check the flow of the program.

When a program crashes, you can look at which print statements executed and where it stopped to locate the issue.

**Tip:** Add print statements before and after key lines of code to find out where things go wrong.

## Check Variable Values

If something unexpected happens, print out the values of your variables to verify that they are as expected.

**Tip:** This helps test whether conditions and logic are working correctly. Try changing variable values and observing the output to better understand the program’s behavior.

## Debugging with IDEs

Modern IDEs like **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, and **NetBeans** come with powerful built-in debugging tools.

You can:
- Set **breakpoints** to pause the program at specific lines  
- **Step through** code line by line  
- **Inspect variable values** in real time  

**Tip:** Use your IDE's debugger to find errors faster — it’s more efficient and detailed than print statements alone.

## Debugging Checklist

- ✅ Read the full error message — it often tells you exactly what’s wrong  
- ✅ Check if all variables are initialized before use  
- ✅ Print variable values to trace the problem  
- ✅ Watch for **off-by-one errors** in loops and arrays  
- ✅ Comment out sections of code to isolate bugs
